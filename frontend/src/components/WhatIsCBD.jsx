											<h5 className="text-center">What is CBD?</h5>
											CBD is a term that has been thrown around a lot but what it stands for is Cannabidiol. 
											CBD is one of the most common types of cannabinoid compounds found in the cannabis sativa plant of which accounts for up to 40% of the plant's extract. 
											Δ9-THC, or commonly referred to as just THC, and CBD both have therapeutic applications. 
											However, CBD is emerging as a therapeutic agent over THC since it lacks the psychoactive side effects found in THC. Or to put it simply, CBD will not get you “high”. 
											The fact that CBD is non-psychoactive makes it an appealing option for anyone looking for relief from inflammation, pain, anxiety, psychosis, seizures, spasms, 
											and other conditions without having to worry about disconcerting feelings of lethargy or dysphoria.
										</p>
										<p>
											<h5 className="text-center">How does CBD work?</h5>
											When ingested, CBD has a peripheral effect on the body’s endogenous cannabinoid system, the largest self-regulatory system within the human body. Governing a wide range of physiological activities, this system has receptor sites well expressed throughout the human body. CBD produces many beneficial effects on the human molecular pathway. As a matter of fact, there are more than 65 molecular targets of CBD in the body. Topical application of cannabinoids may avoid the digestive tract and potentially also supplement this EndoCannabinoid System.

											<h5 className="text-center">Industrial Hemp vs. Marijuana</h5>
											The question we hear all the time is, what is the difference between hemp and marijuana? When it comes down to it, there are some major ways in which industrial hemp and marijuana differ. Just looking at the appearance of the two plants marijuana resembles a short and fat bush while hemp plants tend to be very tall and skinny. This plays into the difference in an environment where both are grown. Hemp is grown closely together and is typically grown in large multi-acre plots. It can also grow in a variety of climates. But, unlike hemp, marijuana requires very specific conditions where it can grow and is “ruined” when encountering those non-ideal conditions. The biggest difference between the two, however, is its chemical composition. In the eyes of the federal government, hemp is deemed as a cannabis plant with a concentration of less than 0.3% THC which they call “Low THC”. This means that ingestible products derived from hemp are essentially impossible to make you “high” or feel and psychoactive effect.

											<h5 className="text-center">The CBD We Use</h5>
											All the CBD we use goes through a rigorous Triple Lab TestedTM  process. Which means it is tested by independent laboratories at 3 points in the production process. These third-party lab tests, examine the hemp oil to verify the concentration of cannabinoids, like CBD. The labs also test for contamination including mold, mildew, fungus, yeast, E.coli, salmonella, mycotoxins, heavy metals, and residual solvents to protect the end user from any contamination. With these standards, we ensure that you receive the highest quality CBD hemp oil available.
											<br/>
											Our CBD is a full-spectrum hemp oil which means it contains various other cannabinoids, Omega 3 & 6 essential fatty acids, and over a dozen vitamins and minerals, like iron, calcium, magnesium, vitamins A, B, C, and E, and beta-Carotene, often missing from the average diet. Due to this nutritional content, full-spectrum CBD hemp oil can be a complete daily dietary supplement.

											<h5 className="text-center">Benefits of CBD</h5>
											The large numbers of individuals who use CBD oil have reaped from its underlying benefits, leaving positive remarks about the efficiency of the substance. There has been plenty of scientific and clinical research —much of it sponsored by the US government— that underscores CBD’s potential as a treatment for a wide range of conditions. Don’t just take our word for it, view the research for yourself!

							<p>
								CBD is a term that has been thrown around a lot but what it stands for is Cannabidiol. 
								CBD is one of the most common types of cannabinoid compounds found in the cannabis sativa plant of which accounts for up to 40% of the plant's extract. 
								Δ9-THC, or commonly referred to as just THC, and CBD both have therapeutic applications. 
								However, CBD is emerging as a therapeutic agent over THC since it lacks the psychoactive side effects found in THC. Or to put it simply, CBD will not get you “high”. 
								The fact that CBD is non-psychoactive makes it an appealing option for anyone looking for relief from inflammation, pain, anxiety, psychosis, seizures, spasms, 
								and other conditions without having to worry about disconcerting feelings of lethargy or dysphoria.

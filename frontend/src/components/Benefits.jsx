								Because CBD oil has not been FDA approved as a cure or treatment for any disease, Gaia’s Choice does not make or support any medical claims related to hemp CBD oil. 
								With that being said, there has been plenty of scientific and clinical research—much of it sponsored by the US government—underscores CBD’s potential as a treatment 
								for a wide range of conditions, including arthritis, diabetes, alcoholism, MS, chronic pain, schizophrenia, PTSD, depression, antibiotic-resistant infections, 
								epilepsy, and other neurological disorders. CBD has demonstrable neuroprotective and neurogenic effects, and its anti-cancer properties are currently being investigated 
								at several academic research centers in the United States and elsewhere.
